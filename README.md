# nepali-calendar-indicator ![Nepcal Screenshot](screenshot.png)

> Simple indicator applet to show Nepali date and calendar

Showing the calendar is not done yet. If anybody wants to contribute, you're welcome to do so :)

## Installation

The goal is to be able to do `pip install nepcal_applet` and have the applet running but there's little bit of work that needs to be done for that.

This requires python 3.x and python-gi. Make sure you have python-pip3 installed.

```shell
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
```

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/techgaun/nepali-calendar-indicator
# if you see permission errors (which should be due to system-wide pip)
sudo pip install git+https://github.com/techgaun/nepali-calendar-indicator
```

### XFCE

This applet should work with Xfce DE once you enable Indicator plugin from `right-click panel > Panel > Panel preferences > Item > Add Item`. If you don't see indicator plugin in the list of items to add, try installing `xfce4-indicator-plugin`.

```shell
sudo apt install -y xfce4-indicator-plugin
```

### Arch Linux (FixMe)

On arch linux with XFCE DE, you can install xfce4-indicator-plugin with:

```shell
yaourt -S xfce4-indicator-plugin
yaourt libappindicator-gtk3
```

I assume the later one should come when you install xfce4-indicator-plugin though.

## Notes

- It currently uses `Asia/Kathmandu` timezone. The date displayed will be the date local to Nepal.
- We have open [issues](https://github.com/techgaun/nepali-calendar-indicator/issues). If you want to contribute, you're more than welcome to grab those.
